# Capstone Project Croma Sales Analysis
Capstone Project for the Certificate of Master in Data Science and Analytics with AI

# Abstract
Croma is one of the top electronic retailers in India, which is a part of the Tata Group of Industries and offers both online and in-store purchasing.
When Croma opened its doors in 2006, it was India's first large format specialty retailer, serving every requirement for multi-brand digital devices and home electronics. 
With more than 150 physical locations in more than 40 major Indian cities, Croma also offers an online shopping platform.

The dataset is provided by Croma, as it looks to address a few business challenges for which a data driven approach is required. The requirements for this dataset are in the form of case studies. **Case Study 1** seeks to look at the sales distribution during special days/ seasons. **Case Study 2** aims to understand the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. **Case Study 3** aims to summarize and categorize reviews from customers for its various products. **Case Study 4** aims to understand the delivery process by looking at the time taken between each stop in the delivery process.

By the time of writing this report I have completed Case Studies 1 and 4, and given an attempt at Case Studies 2 and 3.
